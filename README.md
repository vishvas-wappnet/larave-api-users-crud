Laravel API CRUD for Managing Users
This is a Laravel API that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing users. The API allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a user model, including creating new users, retrieving user information, updating user details, and deleting users from the database.

The API is built using Laravel, a popular PHP web framework, and follows RESTful API principles for handling HTTP requests and responses. It includes routes, controllers, and a model for managing user data, as well as validation and error handling for robustness.
